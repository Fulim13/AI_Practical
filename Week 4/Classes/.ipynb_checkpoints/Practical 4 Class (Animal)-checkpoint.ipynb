    "▪ If we think of inheritance in terms of biology, we can think of a child inheriting certain traits from their parent. \n",
    "\n",
    "▪ That is, a child can inherit a parent’s height or eye color. \n",
    "\n",
    "▪ A child may also share the same last name with his/her/its parents.\n",

    "![](inheritance.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "▪ **Child classes or subclasses will inherit methods and variables from the parent classes or the base classes.**\n",
    "\n",
    "▪ We can think of a parent class called **_Parent_** that has class variables for last_name, height, and eye_color that the child class called **_Child_** will inherit from the Parent.\n",
    "\n",
    "▪ Because the **_Child_** subclass is inheriting from the **_Parent_** base class, the **_Child_** class can reuse the code of **_Parent_**, allowing the programmer to use fewer lines of code and decrease redundancy.\n",

    "## 2.3 Overriding Parent Properties and Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.3.1 Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "▪ So far, we have looked at the **_child_** class **Trout** that made use of the **<font color=blue>pass</font>** keyword to inherit all of the **_parent_** class **_Fish_** behaviors, and another **_child_** class **Clownfish** that inherited all of the **_parent_** class behaviors and also created its own unique **method** that is specific to the **_child_** class. \n",
    "\n",
    "▪ Sometimes, however, we will want to make use of some of the **_parent_** class behaviors only but not all of them. \n",
    "\n",
    "▪ When we change **_parent_** class **methods** we **override** them.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.3.2 Overriding Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "▪ When constructing  **_parent_** and **_child_** classes, it is important to keep program design in mind so that **overriding** does not produce unnecessary or redundant code.\n",
    "\n",
    "▪ We’ll create a **_Shark class_** which is the subclass of the **_Fish class_**. \n",
    "\n",
    "▪ Because we created the **_Fish_** class with the idea that we would be creating primarily **bony fish**, we’ll have to make adjustments for the **_Shark class_**, that is instead a **cartilaginous fish**. \n",
    "\n",
    "▪ In terms of program design, if we had more than one **non-bony fish**, we would most likely want to make separate classes for each of these two types of fish.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.3.3 The Shark class\n",
    "\n",
    "▪ Unlike bony fish, **sharks have skeletons made of cartilage** instead of bone; they also **have eyelids** but they are **unable to swim backwards**. \n",
    "    \n",
    "▪ Sharks can, however, maneuver themselves backwards by sinking</font>.\n",
    "\n",

    "Time is a class. Time has the attributes of hour, minute and second. The default values of the attributes are zero (0), but the constructor of the class allows the hour, minute and second to be set by the user when an instance is created. Time has a method called tick(), which will increase the second by 1 each time it is executed. Therefore after 10,000 iterations of tick(), the “hour” attribute will increase by 2, the “minute” will increase by 46, and the “second” will increase by 40. Hence, printing the Time instance after 10,000 iterations of tick() will display 2:46:40 on the screen if all the attributes of hour, minute and second are not set.  On the other side, if the attributes are set as 13 hours, 20 minutes and 5 seconds when the instance is created, then printing the Time instance after 10,000 iterations of tick() will result in 16:6:45 displayed on the screen. 3"

    "Date is a class. Date has the attributes of day, month and year. Each month has either 30 or 31 days, except that February has 28 days in general. Date has a method called advance(), which will increase the day by 1 each time it is executed. Therefore after 1000 iterations of advance(), without considering the leap year, the year will increase by 2 (i.e. 730 days), and the month will increase by 8 (i.e. 243 days), and the day will increase by 27. Hence, printing the Date instance after 1000 iterations of advance() will display 27/8/2 (2 years 8 months 27 days) on the screen, if the attributes of day, month and year are not set. However, if the attributes are set as 1 day, 7 month and 2016 year when the instance is created, then printing the Date instance after 1000 iterations of advance() will display 28/3/2019 on the screen.
